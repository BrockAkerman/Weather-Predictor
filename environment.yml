You can replace the “Status” section as you progress.

## 🚀 **4. Commit + Push to GitHub**

Once the empty structure + README is committed, you have officially begun.

This is the real psychological hurdle.

# 🎨 **STEP 2 — Plan for Your GitHub.io Portfolio**

You said you want this project showcased on your personal GitHub Pages site.

Perfect — here’s how this will work later:

1. On your `username.github.io` site, you’ll create a new page:  
   **“Flight Delay Prediction”**

2. That page will contain:
   - Project summary  
   - Visuals from your EDA  
   - A link to your repo  
   - A link to your Streamlit app (if you build one)  

3. I can help you generate:
   - The HTML/Markdown for the project page  
   - Interactive visualizations  
   - A polished, professional write-up  

But this all comes *after* you’ve got the repo started.

Right now, **your only job is to get the skeleton up**.

# ⭐ If you'd like, I can generate your initial files for you

I can produce:

- `README.md`  
- `environment.yml` with DS libraries  
- Empty `.py` modules  
- A homepage snippet for your GitHub.io portfolio  

Just say: **“Yes, generate the starter files”**  
and I’ll output everything with copy/paste blocks.

You’re not stuck — you’re at the **beginning of your pivot**, and this is the right move. I’ve got you all the way through this project.
